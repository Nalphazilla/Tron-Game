# Tron Light Cycle Game - Invulnerability System

## New Features Added

### 3-Second Invulnerability on Spawn
- **Player Protection**: All players (human and AI) are invulnerable for 3 seconds after spawning
- **Collision Behavior**: During invulnerability, players collide with obstacles and other players but don't die
- **Visual Feedback**: A light wall surrounds each player during the invulnerability period

### Light Wall System
- **Appearance**: Cylindrical light wall that matches the player's color
- **Effects**: Pulsing glow effect with dynamic intensity
- **Duration**: Automatically disappears after 3 seconds
- **Position**: Follows the player and maintains proper positioning

### Enhanced Collision Handling
- **Player Collisions**: Players bounce off each other instead of dying when invulnerable
- **Boundary Collisions**: Players bounce back from arena boundaries instead of dying
- **Obstacle Collisions**: Players bounce back from obstacles and trails instead of dying
- **Visual Effects**: Special particle effects for each type of collision

### UI Indicators
- **Invulnerability Timer**: Shows remaining invulnerability time for human player
- **Color Coding**: Green (2-3s), Yellow (1-2s), Red (0-1s) based on remaining time
- **Position**: Centered above the game area for easy visibility

## Technical Implementation

### Player Class Extensions
- `isInvulnerable`: Boolean flag for invulnerability state
- `invulnerabilityTimer`: Timestamp when invulnerability started
- `invulnerabilityDuration`: Duration in milliseconds (3000ms = 3s)
- `lightWall`: Reference to the visual light wall object

### New Methods
- `activateInvulnerability()`: Enables invulnerability and creates light wall
- `createLightWall()`: Generates the cylindrical light wall mesh
- `updateLightWall()`: Updates position and effects of the light wall
- `checkInvulnerability()`: Checks timer and disables invulnerability when expired
- `removeLightWall()`: Cleans up the light wall object
- `handleInvulnerableCollision()`: Manages player-to-player collisions
- `handleBoundaryBounce()`: Manages boundary collisions
- `handleObstacleBounce()`: Manages obstacle collisions

### Visual Effects
- `createCollisionEffect()`: Particle explosion for player collisions
- `createBoundaryBounceEffect()`: Ripple effect for boundary bounces
- `createObstacleBounceEffect()`: Spark effect for obstacle bounces

### Game Loop Integration
- Invulnerability checks run every frame
- Light wall updates every frame
- UI indicator updates every frame
- Proper cleanup on player death or game reset

## Usage

1. **Start a new game** - All players automatically get 3 seconds of invulnerability
2. **During invulnerability** - Players can collide safely with visual feedback
3. **After 3 seconds** - Light wall disappears and normal death mechanics resume
4. **Visual feedback** - Watch the timer and light wall effects

## Compatibility

- Works with all game modes (PvP, PvA, 1v3AI)
- Compatible with all maps
- No changes to existing game mechanics after invulnerability expires
- Maintains performance with efficient cleanup and disposal

## Future Enhancements

- Configurable invulnerability duration
- Different light wall styles per player
- Sound effects for collisions and bounces
- Power-up system for extending invulnerability
